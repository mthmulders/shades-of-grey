If you like it, feel free, fork it!
If you use it and find something missing or not working as expected, please send me pull request.

The `preview/` directory contains a simple Reveal.js presentation to showcase the theme.
It contains slides with code, with a mathematical equation, with a picture, a quote...

To use it, first run `npm i`, since it links to the Reveal.js package that is downloaded using npm.
Then, run the following two commands:
1. `npm run update-reveal` to import template for Reveal.js themes
1. `npm run dev` to start hacking.

Your browser should open the preview slide deck automatically.
